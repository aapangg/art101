		<h1> Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
							<h2>Challenges</h2>
									<p>Working with your partner, create a function that
								depends on conditionals. </p>
							<h2>Problems</h2>
									<p>The main problem that I ran into was making sure there were
									no typos in the Javascript file. I had a lot of trouble making
								sure there were no errors but with the help of my partner I was able
							to get it working.</p>
							<h2>Results</h2>
									<p>We both created our own browsers for this Lab.</p>
